description: Sharing some experience from my first, longer remote work & how it affected my life.
---

Last month, on January, we decided to pack our bags, leave unpleasant winter at home and set up on the journey to Thailand. Now, I would like to share some experience & how it affected my developer's life. Don't expect any code.

I had seeds of reluctance towards longer nights and grey streets in my head for longer, so when my colleague suddenly exclaimed *"Let's have winter office in Thailand"*, I was sold immediately. But I had little to no experience in working remotely, so here are my learning.

## Importance of exercise

The first and one of the most important points I'd like to strengthen is a necessity to do physical exercises, like hiking, cycling or just going to gym, probably depending on your location, and start practising shortly after arrival to your nomadic destination. I made a little mistake by skipping my running routine during my first days, simply because Bangkok without usual pavements didn't seem to be an ideal place for such an activity.

*Wrong!* Later it proved to be possible, it required just some improvisation, get by with less or making sure you live close to a park. The only reasonable outcome was prolonged period of sleepless period of jet lag, followed by disharmonious days without strict lines between work and rest, fixed immediately with the first exercise.

## Bad organization habits are magnified

I *really* like working for my current company, [Kiwi.com](https://www.kiwi.com), I'm helping people travel after all (or at least I'm telling myself this) and it's giving me a feeling of well-functioning community of people, so don't get me wrong if the following sentences make you think otherwise. Kiwi was born just a few years ago and at one point, experienced exponential growth in crazy short time. As a current consequence, I miss higher levels of efficiency in some areas of development. 

When your normal communication is broken between people sitting next to each other and things are not properly sorted out during refinements, planning and retrospective meetings, it's far worse when you step away. And as you are constantly experiencing new things, riding a roller coaster, it can become frustrating when you need to dedicate additional energy to suck out critical information from colleagues and when no one knows how to cope with remoteness or isn't taking it into account. Which brings me to the next point.

## Human traits

Due to our revolutionary past, living a simple life in tribes, we are prone to many cognitive biases, as it's already described in [much](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16248196-the-art-of-thinking-clearly). [better](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow). [publications](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36064445-skin-in-the-game). than this silly-almost-blog. And some of them can affect your nomad style damn hard.

*Not invented here* syndrome, naturally inhabiting corporate sphere, is first coming to my mind. As a nomad, you aren't part of any tribe, so be prepared to defend more against *what-this-strange-dude-is-doing-for-god-sake* situations.

To fight back problems arising from it, try to avoid too much-written conversation via Slack and various messaging systems, prefer calls instead. I did such mistake and it led to several misunderstandings I regretted. Also make sure to *always* turn on the camera, even if you aren't the one who speaks. Note all the studies proving actual content makes an only small portion of your message (they just can't agree on the exact number).

## Leaving the shell

![Expecting unexpected](/images/posts/2018-02-expecting-unexpected-bangkok.jpg)

Huh, such negativism, you may think. What's my point in doing so, then?

The thing is, benefits prevail by a *large* margin.

The trip to Thailand (together with the preceding and following travels) changed me, and hey, I'm not bulls*iting now. Here is the list of things I started doing since my short return:

- I started writing a diary. 
- I filled conference call for papers.
- I came back to learning Haskell (!).
- I subscribed to art lessons, not drawing for ten years.
- I resolved an ongoing issue with water tap (not me personally, though).
- I convinced myself to run in the morning more often than once per month. In winter.  
- I'm finally trying to kick off this blog.

The will is a finite resource, but the good news is [it's said](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12609433-the-power-of-habit) it can be trained. And I find remote work to be an amazing training.

In order to work properly in an unknown city, foreign culture, you have to overcome many obstacles. And then, when you come back home, rudimentary complaints of people around you look ridiculous. And my cynicism toward main media topics is way off the limits I nearly stopped reading it. By the way, I started touching parts of the codebase I previously avoided.

I also completely re-shifted list of topics to be asked in potential interviews, going from technical stuff in beginnings, through questions about processes and product to a discussion about remote work. And I plan to ask this question even if I decide to settle down completely. Because I trust it will tell me a lot about how people react to peculiarities & unexpected situations, barriers in heads and toxic intentions to have everything under control, which is one of the usual obstacles to perform our jobs efficiently. 

## Organizing a meetup

To level it bit further, we came up with the idea to organize special JavaScript meetup during our stay in Bangkok. Although we started in rather chamber atmosphere, audience slowly grew up to about 30 people. I hoped for more people raised in Thailand, audience could be even bigger, but the stories of the people who participated, mostly digital nomads, were truly amazing and inspirational so I'm sharing this here again to give you possible inspiration as well.

## What's next

Nothing has ended by Thailand. We desire to continue on our way. After a little break, I'm already back on the journey and right after we will finish teaching GraphQL in Barcelona, I plan to continue to Morocco, where we will reunite again in one of the Marrakesh cafes. I would like to invite anyone to join us along the way. Since our job of being software developer doesn’t hinge on one specific place, the most boundaries are just conventions in our heads that deserve to be transcended.

And I promise myself to write five proper technical articles until the end of May in compensation for this scream in the dark without a single line of code.

And you can help me in the quest for Marrakesh (future) developers: [Reddit - Offer to help you with JavaScript in Marrakesch](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/80x721/offer_to_help_you_with_javascript_in_marrakesch/)

Improvise, adapt, overcome.
