title: Presentation&#58; The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
---

On April 20th, I gave a speech about JavaScript to developers in Rockaway,
as a part of *"ROCDevs"* presentation series. We touched topics that are commonly
misunderstood in the language and how to deal with them, 
including async operations, event loop or variable scopes.

You can watch the recorded video with slides below (speech is in Czech).
